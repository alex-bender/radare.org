<h2>r2wars</h2>
This game is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War">CoreWar</a>, but running on top of radare2's ESIL emulation. 
To win please submit your bots written in assembly (this time we will accept x86-32, arm64,
arm32, mips) which will run in the same memory space trying to make the othe r bot crash by
corrupting their memory.

<h2>Hackathon</h2>

This competition consists in fixing as much issues as possible of the ones labelled as
"hackathon" in the radare repository & the cutter repository, for the new contributors.
For new people that wants to participate in the Hackathon we suggest to check the
issues labelled with `good first issue`:

* <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3Ahackaton">1st issue radare2</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/cutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3Ahackaton">1st issue cutter</a>

To participate in the radare2CON 2020 hackathon use the labels:

* <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/labels/hackaton">radare2 hackaton label</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/cutter/labels/hackaton">cutter hackaton label</a>


<h2>CTF</h2>

The R2Con CTF is a Jeopardy CaptureTheFlag style competition that must be solved with r2.
You are given several questions, tasks &amp; challenges related to different categories of
RE which may be solved using radare2. Players get points by solving them. Using hints
to solve the challenges lowers the score.


<h2>GSoC</h2>

This is the 7th Summer Of Code competition of radare2, this time we got accepted by
Google in the GSoC, which allows us to bring the oportunity to some students to
learn more about C, reverse engineering and r2 itself thanks to our mentoring. 

The selected students will be presenting their work at the end of summer during the r2con.
