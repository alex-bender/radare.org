    | Thanks to the COVID19 global pandemic we decided to make the conference online.   |
    |                                                                                   |
    | r2con is a the annual conference about <a href="https://radare.org"/>radare2</a>                                    |
    | The conference aims to gather all the r2 users and developers around the world to |
    | enjoy a 4 day event full of experiments, hacking, teaching, discussing and coding |
    | stuff while having fun and drinking beers (safely at home).                       |
    |                                                                                   |
    | Since this year #r2con2020 is online there's no venue restriction,                |
    | therefore there's no need to sign up for Hexploitable's or Tim's workshops!!      | 
    |                                                                                   |

Join the telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/AnoeOVDr7--s_89_DFhyrw">here</a> to contact with skuater and upload your bot for the competition!

This game is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War">CoreWar</a>, but running on top of radare2's ESIL emulation. 
To win please submit your bots written in assembly (this time we will accept x86-32, arm64,
arm32, mips) which will run in the same memory space trying to make the othe r bot crash by
corrupting their memory.

RE which may be solved using radare2. Players get points by solving them. Using hints
to solve the challenges lowers the score.


<a name="GSoC"></a><h2>GSoC</h2>

This is the 7th Summer Of Code competition of radare2, this time we got accepted by
Google in the GSoC, which allows us to bring the oportunity to some students to
learn more about C, reverse engineering and r2 itself thanks to our mentoring. 
To learn more about checkout this link: <a href="https://www.radare.org/gsoc/2020">https://www.radare.org/gsoc/2020</a>

The selected students will be presenting <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4946212249141248">their work</a> at the end of summer during the r2con.
